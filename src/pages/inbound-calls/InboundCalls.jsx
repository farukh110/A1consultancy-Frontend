                            <p>
                                Inbound calls refer to customer phone calls to a company's customer service or support team. These calls are usually managed by the organization's call center or help desk, which then addresses the consumer's complaint or request. Handling incoming calls is fundamental for customer service teams aiming to enhance the customer experience.
                                <br /><br />
                                Inbound calls play a crucial role in customer service and support call centers. Many companies offer a dedicated phone line for customers to voice their concerns or make requests. These organizations possess either an in-house call center or a remote one that handles the calls. Some companies offer the convenience of remote call centers, allowing employees to work from home. This facilitates customer service teams in delivering 24/7 assistance by employing staff in various time zones.
